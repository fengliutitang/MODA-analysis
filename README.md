Multiple Overlapping Deprevation Analysis
This repo contains code made for analysing data for a master's thesis in studying the overlap in domains in which the children are vulnerable. The code is not optimised at all and modifications need to made to the code and can't just be taken as user input, if something else needs to be studied.
